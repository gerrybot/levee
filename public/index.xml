      <description>Okay, this review of Power Of The Doctor is going to be loaded with spoilers, sweetie. But since it&amp;rsquo;s almost a month from the original airdate, you&amp;rsquo;ve really only got yourself to blame, don&amp;rsquo;t you? Anyway&amp;hellip;
It&amp;rsquo;s been a rough run for Jodie Whitaker. The first female Doctor in the show&amp;rsquo;s long history, she was always going to be controversial. The eyes of the world were on her, and a not-unsubstantial number of internet trolls were hoping that she&amp;rsquo;d fail miserably.</description>

      <description>Bad Sisters is the most deftly-written and darkest dramas to grace a streaming service this year. Picture the scene: four Irish sisters from Malahide in Ireland are at their wits&amp;rsquo; end with their vile, controlling brother-in-law, John Paul. So they decide to murder him. Seems reasonable so far, right?
Okay, before we get too far into this review, let&amp;rsquo;s meet our victim: John Paul Williamson. Know affectionately among his in-laws as &amp;ldquo;The Prick&amp;rdquo;.</description>
